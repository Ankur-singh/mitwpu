summary: Everything you need to start your Data Science Journey 
---

Machine Learning is really at its peak. Also, its an exciting field to work in. I have been working in the field for more than 4 years now. I have come to a realization that the **best way to learning machine learning (or rather anything) is by “doing it” yourself.**

Now, the problem is “where to start?”. Internet has tonnes and tonnes of courses, blogs, books and video teaching ML. Its daunting when you first go out and look for ML courses online. Because of all this, its really important for find someone who can guide you along the way. **Trying to learning ML w/o a mentor could be suicide mission**. Not only you will fail (with high probability) but also you will be discouraged enough to give up and never try it again.

Having a mentor to guide you through your ML journey is the best gift you can ever ask for. A mentor can show you the right path, the correct way to do things, practical approach to any / all problem and set you on a path where your dreams start becoming a reality.

**In summary, you need 2 things to learn ML:**

1. Attitude to do things on your own
2. A mentor to guide you through

To answer your question, “best way / place to learn Machine Learning?”. According to me, the best way / place is the one which encourages you to “try things on your own” and provides you “a mentor” to guide you through.

(Ai Adventures)[www.aiadventures.in] is an amazing place to learn. We provide you with everything you will ever need for Machine Learning. Ai Adventures is basically a ML company, building products and providing ML solutions to businesses. Along with this, we also train people in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science.

The special thing about their training program is that, we don’t spoon feed you. Instead we provide you with resources (like jupyter Notebooks, blogs, videos), a schedule (based on your learning style) and a mentor to guide you. You can learn things at your own pace, ask doubts and get them clarified personally. Not just this, you can also develop projects and get an internship certificate as well.

Final words:

We encourages you to try things on your own. We provide a mentor to pay personal attention and guide you. Also, you will get a chance to implement/practice all the knowledge that you have acquired. What else do you need?

### Course methodology

- Implementation focused: This course aims to make students learn by coding themselves rather than watch someone else. We have found that this method of learning makes the students independent and facilitates them to learn new technologies in the future with ease. 
- Asking for help: Students programming for the first time will naturally need help. Remember that we are here to help! Don't be afraid to ask for help regarding any topic you come across.
- Not a classroom: We encourage you to interact not just with other students, but with the volunteers as well. If you need a break, you can simply take one! No need to ask. Just makes sure that you submit your assignments before their respective deadlines and are present during the last hour of the day as we have some real life use cases planned for you.

### Course features

- Hands-on: Through out the training program, you will we writing tonnes of python code. Towards the end, we are pretty certain that you will gain enough confidence in your coding skills that you can flaunt it among your friends. Students will no longer be afraid of coding, that's for sure!
- Application Oriented: The primary focus of the program is make sure we provide individuals with knowledge that is practical. Knowledge that they can use to solve real world problems, Knowledge that is not limited to books and classrooms. The complete course content is designed and curated with applications & use-cases in mind. Students will be easily able to crack Data Science interview & develop projects!
- Data Science use cases: We will have a lot of data science use-cases discussed. These use cases are a great way for you to get in the mind of a data scientist. We will also be discussing some state of the art technologies and advances in various domains of artificial intelligence.

### Course target

No matter what your background, we are confident that you can learn & become a Data Scientist!
- Complete beginner to programming: The course material should be a perfect fit for you :). The material starts with the fundamentals of programming. Python is a great language to learn as your first language because of its simple learning curve so you have made the right decision choosing it!
- Familiarity with ML/DL concepts: You will learn to translate concepts/idea to code. Theory is not enough to solve real-world problems, we will help you understand the practical aspects of ML/DL projects. 
- Used ML/DL frameworks before: Shoot for the moon! See if you can get yourself to the top of the leaderboard. Make full use of this opportunity by attending the use cases, ask a lot of questions and interact with us; to learn the best practices in the industry.
