### Course methodology

- Implementation focused: This course aims to make students learn by coding themselves rather than watch someone else. We have found that this method of learning makes the students independent and facilitates them to learn new technologies in the future with ease. 
- Asking for help: Students programming for the first time will naturally need help. Remember that we are here to help! Don't be afraid to ask for help regarding any topic you come across.
- Not a classroom: We encourage you to interact not just with other students, but with the volunteers as well. If you need a break, you can simply take one! No need to ask. Just makes sure that you submit your assignments before their respective deadlines and are present during the last hour of the day as we have some real life use cases planned for you.
