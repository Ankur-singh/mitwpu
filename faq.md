### Why this workshop?
We use a different training model as opposed to classroom training which can be mundane and also unfair as it doesn't go by everyone's pace. With AI Adventures, you have access to a self paced course which covers the fundamentals of Deep Learning with a strong focus on implementation. 

### What will you learn by the end of the workshop?
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to build simple but useful Deep Learning models and also be confident in your ability to learn new technologies and concepts in the field of Deep Learning ahead.

### Why learn python?
Python is one of the most widely used programming languages. It has a strong open source community and is used in various domains like machine learning, web development, scientific computing and many more. It was rated the most important skill on the stack overflow developer survey for the past two years in a row!

### Do I need to get my own laptop?
Yes. We expect you to get your own laptops with anaconda installed. Head over to the [prerequisites]({{ site.baseurl }}/prerequisites) section to learn more.

### How to register for the course?
For those who have not yet registered, use this [google form](https://forms.gle/DdVgmyuEBA46kH2PA). Stay tuned for the time table and details! 

### What are the steps taken in an industrial machine learning project?
We have an entire [blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/pipeline) which covers this topic!

### What are the possible career prospects in machine learning?
Head over to our [careers]({{ site.baseurl }}/careers) tab for a detailed explaination.

### How can I learn machine learning/Deep Learning?
If you like what we have to offer, we have a comprehensive course on machine learning which is built from the ground up! You will learn about data cleaning using modules like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/). The course also covers data analysis and visualizations through [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). We then proceed to explore the theory of machine learning and implement it using [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)! Similarly, we have a full-fledged course on deep learning.
